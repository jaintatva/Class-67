Once upon a time, in a forest a Lion was sleeping suddenly a Mouse came on his back and waked Lion up.
Lion became angry and decided to eat the Mouse. Mouse requested leave me I will help you whenever you need help.
One day a Hunter came a captured the king of the jungle Lion in the nets. He growled loudly.
The growl was heard by the Mouse. Mouse came to help the Lion as he had promised. Mouse cut the nets and Lion got free.
So the moral of the story is 'Always the smaller ones by the nature comes in help'.
So friends what did you learn, Will you help others?
